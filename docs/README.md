# Don't Panic

“Don’t Panic” is a Python-based gamified training platform designed to simulate realistic
cybersecurity incidents and guide users through the critical stages of incident response. The
system immerses trainees in branching, scenario-based exercises where their decisions
determine the outcome of unfolding security crises — from minor disruptions to full-scale
breaches.

The platform’s primary purpose is to help users develop and reinforce decision-making skills
under pressure. Each simulation replicates authentic workplace incidents such as data leaks,
insider misuse, malware outbreaks, unauthorized access, or physical security breaches. Users
must decide how to contain the threat, communicate with relevant parties, and execute recovery
actions, following established frameworks like NIST SP 800-61 or SANS Incident Response
Steps (Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned).

The system uses a “choose-your-path” narrative format, where every decision dynamically
alters the storyline and its consequences. Mistakes can escalate the situation into catastrophic
outcomes, reinforcing the importance of timely and well-coordinated responses. Each
completed scenario ends with a structured debrief that explains what went wrong, what was
handled correctly, and how to improve response strategies in future incidents.

An adaptive learning engine analyzes each participant’s choices and identifies weak areas —
such as delayed containment or improper escalation — then adjusts upcoming scenarios to
emphasize those skills. This ensures that training is personalized, progressive, and relevant to
each user’s strengths and weaknesses.
